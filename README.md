## Installation üíª

Please see [the installation guide](INSTALL.md) for information about installing
Coughingcatcoin Core.

### Such ports

Coughingcatcoin Core by default uses port `34701` for peer-to-peer communication that
is needed to synchronize the "mainnet" blockchain and stay informed of new
transactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSONRPC port can be opened, which
defaults to port `34702` for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended to not
expose RPC ports to the public internet.

| Function | mainnet | testnet | regtest |
| :------- | ------: | ------: | ------: |
| P2P      |   34701 |   34801 |   34901 |
